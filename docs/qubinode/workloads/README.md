# OpenShift Workloads
[Jig - Workshop Service Worker](jig.md)
> Jig is the back-end service that allows workshop proctors to easily set up and provide seamless workshop student experiences.  A Workshop Proctor will log into Jig and create an Event.  That Event has all the needed student workshop details such as what Domain, Workshop ID, and Student User ID Numbers are auto-assigned and monitored as they progress through the workshops.Those 3 details (Domain, Workshop ID, pointing and numbering workshop participants with a User ID usually would take a substantial amount of time and cause a lot of confusion.  Monitoring student activity is based on the front-end workshop curriculum, like that found at https://redhatgov.io - no special work is required on the curriculum authors or the workshop architects.

The letter K has reference to Kubernetes, the base for OpenShift as the target cloud platform for Kogito, and to the Knowledge Is Everything (KIE) open source business automation project from which Kogito originates.
