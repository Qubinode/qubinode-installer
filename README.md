# Qubinode Installer
Qubinode is a single node OpenShift cluster powered by Red Hatâ€™s suite of hybrid cloud technologies.

## Motivation
Qubinode is for users wanting to stand up an OpenShift cluster in a secure and controlled environment with the flexibility to carry the cluster wherever you want. It is intended for those who need to simulate as close as possible a production type OpenShift cluster on a single bare metal node.

## What is OpenShift?
* OCP - is Red Hat's on-premises private platform as a service product, built around a core of application containers powered by Docker, with orchestration and management provided by Kubernetes, on a foundation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
* OKD - The Origin Community Distribution of Kubernetes that powers Red Hat OpenShift.

The installer supports installing Red Hat OpenShift (OCP) or The Origin Community Distribution of Kubernetes (OKD).
 - Current state is support only exist for OKD3. Installing OCP3 or OCP4 will require a Red Hat subscription.
 - Installing OCP3 or OCP4 will requires a Red Hat OpenShift subscription. Please contact Red Hat slaes.
 - The base OS is RHEL. If you are installing OKD3 you can take advantage of the no-cost RHEL subscription available at developers.redhat.com.

* Server with at least 64 GB Memory
* Server With at least 1 TB of Secondary Hard Drive
* Ansible version 2.6 and up
* RHEL7
