## Motivation
Qubinode is for users wanting to stand up an OpenShift cluster in a secure and controlled environment with the flexibility to carry the cluster wherever you want. It is intended for those who need to simulate as close as possible a production type OpenShift cluster on a single bare metal node.

## What is OpenShift?
* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) - is Red Hat's private platform as a service product, built around a core of application containers powered by Kubernetes and on the foundations of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
* OKD - The Origin Community Distribution of Kubernetes that powers Red Hat OpenShift.

**The installer supports installing (OCP) or (OKD)**
 - Current state is the installer primarly supports deploying OKD 3.11.x, OCP 3.11.x, and OCP4 4.3 builds. Installing OCP3 or OCP4 will require a Red Hat subscription.

## Requirements

**Baremetal Hardware**
* At least 32 GB of memory, 128 GB is recommended.
* At least 300 GB SSD or NVME dedicated storage, 1TB is recomneded.
