# Qubinode Installer
Qubinode is for users wanting to stand up an RHEL based lab environment running on KVM.

## Motivation
The primary focus of this project is make it easy for you to deploy a OpenShift cluster on a single bare metal node with production like characteristics.

## What is OpenShift?
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) - is Red Hat's private platform as a service product, built around a core of application containers powered by Kubernetes and on the foundations of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

## Resource requirements for OpenShift cluster

**Baremetal Hardware**
* At least 32 GiB of memory, 128 GiB is recommended.
* At least 300 GiB SSD or NVME dedicated storage, 1TB is recomneded.

The qubinode-installer can deploy a 3 node cluster on a system with 32GiB memory.
For the best possible experince 128 GiB of memory is recommended. This will allow
for the default deployment of a cluster with 3 controlplane and 3 computes.

**Software**
* Red Hat Enteprise Linux 8.2 installed (Recommended)
* or Red Hat Enteprise Linux 7.8 installed
Refer to the _[hardware recommendation for lab hardware suggestions](docs/qubinode/hardwareguide.md)_.
The required base OS is Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.8 refer to the [Getting Started Guide](docs/README.md)
